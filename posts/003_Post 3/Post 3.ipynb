    "A 42-year-old nulligravid woman comes to the office because of a 1-year history of increasingly irregular vaginal bleeding and menstrual cramps. Previously, menses occurred at regular 28-day intervals and lasted 3 days with minimal cramping. During the past year, menstrual periods have occurred at 21- to 28-day intervals and lasted 10 to 12 days with increasingly severe pain. Use of acetaminophen and ibuprofen has provided minimal relief. She used an oral contraceptive from the age of 17 years to 40 years, but she discontinued use after she was diagnosed with deep venous thrombosis of the right lower extremity. She has no other history of serious illness and takes no medications. Her mother and sister underwent hysterectomy at the ages of 39 and 43 years, respectively, because of abnormal uterine bleeding. The patient is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 75 kg (165 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination discloses an enlarged, irregularly shaped uterus with nodularity. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms?\n",

    "The patient is brought by his mother because of a 1-month history of bleeding gums after brushing his teeth, increasingly severe muscle and joint pain, fatigue, and easy bruising. His mother says he has lost six baby teeth and has been irritable during this time. Use of acetaminophen has provided minimal relief of his pain. He has autism spectrum disorder. He is not toilet-trained. He has a 10-word vocabulary. Vital signs and oxygen saturation on room air are within normal limits. The patient appears alert but does not speak or make eye contact. Skin is pale and coarse. Examination of the scalp shows erythematous hair follicles. Dentition is poor, and gingivae bleed easily to touch. Multiple ecchymoses and petechiae are noted over the trunk and all extremities. There is marked swelling and tenderness to palpation of the elbow, wrist, knee, and ankle joints. He moves all extremities in a limited, guarded manner. Deep tendon reflexes are absent throughout.

    "Clearly, Chat GPT is knowledgeable about medical procedures and conditions. It also has the ability to recommend next steps when given certain medical information. It seems to have the ability to stand in as a doctor that you would talk to over the phone. While it cannot physically provide medical examinations and surgeries, it covers many of the textbook knowledge required by doctors. If there is developement in the area of the physical applications of Chat GPT I think this would be an interesting area where Chat GPT would excel in assisting doctors with procedures and reminding them of the implications of certain conditions.\n",
