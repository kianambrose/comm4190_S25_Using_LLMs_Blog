Therefore, I moved on to testing its specific medical knowledge by giving it a few questions from the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE), taken directly from the official USMLE website.

    "A 42-year-old nulligravid woman comes to the office because of a 1-year history of increasingly irregular vaginal bleeding and menstrual cramps. Previously, menses occurred at regular 28-day intervals and lasted 3 days with minimal cramping. During the past year, menstrual periods have occurred at 21- to 28-day intervals and lasted 10 to 12 days with increasingly severe pain. Use of acetaminophen and ibuprofen has provided minimal relief. She used an oral contraceptive from the age of 17 to 40 but discontinued it after being diagnosed with deep venous thrombosis in the right lower extremity. She has no other serious illnesses and takes no medications. Her mother and sister underwent hysterectomy at ages 39 and 43, respectively, due to abnormal uterine bleeding. The patient is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 75 kg (165 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m². Vital signs are normal. Physical examination reveals an enlarged, irregularly shaped uterus with nodularity.

His mother says he has lost six baby teeth and has been irritable during this time. Acetaminophen has provided minimal relief. He has autism spectrum disorder, is not toilet-trained, and has a 10-word vocabulary. Vital signs and oxygen saturation on room air are within normal limits. The patient appears alert but does not speak or make eye contact. His skin is pale and coarse. Examination of the scalp shows erythematous hair follicles. Dentition is poor, and gingivae bleed easily to touch. Multiple ecchymoses and petechiae are noted over the trunk and extremities. There is marked swelling and tenderness in the elbow, wrist, knee, and ankle joints. He moves all extremities in a limited, guarded manner. Deep tendon reflexes are absent throughout.

    "Clearly, ChatGPT demonstrates a strong understanding of medical procedures and conditions. It also shows the ability to recommend next steps when provided with relevant medical information. While it cannot perform physical examinations or surgeries, it encompasses much of the textbook knowledge required by physicians. If there is future development in the realm of physical applications for ChatGPT, I believe it could excel in assisting doctors with procedures and in reminding them of the implications of specific conditions."
