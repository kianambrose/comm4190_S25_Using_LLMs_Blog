Chat GPT also correctly kept the blue eyes that I told it to include from before. Finally, the background of the image was more like that of the image I provided, with wood floors running beneath the dog. \n",

Almost all of the coloring on the dog is accurate and it also was able to get the eyes correctly colored even without me directing it to make them blue.

Finally, it identified key behavioral qualities of the dog, all of which are correct and qualities that my dog actually has. \n",

    "Here, Chat GPT was less accurate when producing the image of the dogs. Especially when creating the image of my mini aussie, Chat GPT created a dog that did not really look like my dog in terms of shape, fur, and face. However, Chat GPT did a pretty good job of recreating the sizes of the dogs in relation to one another. It also was able to match the colors of the dogs fairly well and the background matches the scenery in the original image.\n",

    "This slightly surprised me. When I gave Chat GPT more information it produced an image that was less like the original image. In this image the dogs look less like the ones it originally produced. The size and color of the dogs was completely messed up. \n",
    "\n",
    "It seems that Chat GPT became confused when there were too many instructions given in producing the image. Instead, it may be better to let Chat GPT take the reigns and produce what it see's, without providing input as to what is in the image. I think this area of Chat GPT still needs to be tested more and I am curious how well Chat GPT will be able to take constructive criticism on its images in the near future.\n"
