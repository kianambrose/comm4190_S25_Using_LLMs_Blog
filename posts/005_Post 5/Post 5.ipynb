    "\n",
    "In 1880 a letter was sent from Horace Howard Furness containing 20+ pages of unknown writing. The type of writing or language remains unknown to this day. The mysterious letter is believed to have been from a spiritual reading that was a popular occurrence at the time. In the 1880s, spiritual readings were closely tied to the Spiritualist movement, which peaked in popularity during the late 19th century. Spiritualism was based on the belief that the living could communicate with the spirits of the dead, often through mediums who conducted s√©ances, automatic writing, and clairvoyant readings."

    "# Can Chat GPT identify what the letter is saying?\n",
    "\n",
    "While there is currently no way for me to verify if Chat GPT's interpretation of the letter is correct, I was interested in determining if Chat GPT could come up with a reasonable interpretation of what was being said based on the context of the letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is my exchange with Chat GPT:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ShortHand1.png\" width=\"50%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I wanted to see if Chat GPT had any predictions of the type of writing that was in the letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ShortHand2.png\" width=\"50%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Chat GPT correctly identifies a few possibilities for what the writing could have been. I decided to have Chat GPT pursue the idea that it could be Gregg Shorthand. I asked Chat GPT if it is familiar with Gregg Shorthand and if it is able to translate the image into English.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ShortHand3.png\" width=\"50%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, Chat GPT hypothesizes what the letter could be saying. It is still somewhat uncertain and from its response, I am not confident in its ability to tell me what is said in the writing. To help with this, I have Chat GPT break down how it came to its conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ShortHand4.png\" width=\"50%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that I know Chat GPT can go symbol by symbol and attempt to translate what is written, I wanted to give Chat GPT more context to see if it would help Chat GPT understand if it was analyzing using the correct language.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ShortHand5.png\" width=\"50%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Chat GPT suggested a different type of shorthand called Duployan Shorthand, so I decided to pursue this as a better possibility. I asked Chat GPT to translate a single line, given that it was written in Duployan Shorthand.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ShortHand6.png\" width=\"50%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, Chat GPT reprocessed the image and made it clearer, allowing it to go stroke by stroke and produce a possible translation. Again, the translations seem consistent with what is typically written down in spiritual readings, even without explicitly telling Chat GPT that it was from one.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then repeated this process of going line by line for a couple of pages and then asked Chat GPT for its thoughts. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ShortHand7.png\" width=\"50%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Chat GPT also identified the themes in the language that led it to believe it was from a spiritual reading. Chat GPT's ability to connect its interpretation to the spiritual readings increased my confidence in its translations and led me to believe that it may actually be correctly translating certain parts of the letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then gave Chat GPT some more context as to whose name was on the envelope of the letter. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ShortHand8.png\" width=\"50%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Chat GPT is able to provide a hypothesis for further context of the letter. Based on my own research on the side, everything that it suggested seems to be a plausible explanation for why the letter was being associated with him, and what interest he had in the letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going forward it would be interesting to compare these findings to those of an expert on the subject and analyze if Chat GPT is moving in the correct direction and if it is able to translate more of the letter.\n",
