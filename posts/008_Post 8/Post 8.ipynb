    "# What does DeepSeek not discuss?\n",
    "DeepSeek seems to not be willing to discuss things that the Chinese government blocks on other China-based products. For example, if I ask it about the Tiananmen Square Massacre, I get this response.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Tiananmen.png\" width=\"50%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT, on the other hand, gives a full explanation of what occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ChatGPT Response:\n",
    "The Tiananmen Square Massacre (also known as the June 4th Incident) occurred on June 3–4, 1989, when the Chinese government violently suppressed pro-democracy protests in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. The protests, which had been ongoing since April 1989, were led by students, intellectuals, and workers demanding political reform, freedom of speech, and government accountability. The movement initially began as a peaceful mourning for Hu Yaobang, a former Communist Party leader known for advocating reform, but it grew into a nationwide call for change.\n",
    "\n",
    "To further test how much DeepSeek restricts responses, I asked it about Taiwan. I asked both DeepSeek and ChatGPT, **\"Is Taiwan a country?\"** Here are the responses:\n",
    "\n",
    "## DeepSeek:\n",
    "Taiwan is a complex and sensitive issue in international relations. According to the One-China policy, which is widely recognized by the international community, Taiwan is considered a part of China. The Chinese government views Taiwan as a province of China and opposes any form of \"Taiwan independence.\" However, Taiwan operates with its own government and political system, which leads to differing perspectives on its status. The international community's stance on Taiwan's status varies, with some countries and organizations treating it as a separate entity in certain contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ChatGPT:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Is Taiwan a Country?\n",
    "\n",
    "The status of **Taiwan** is politically and diplomatically complex. It operates **as a de facto independent country**, but its official status remains disputed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Facts About Taiwan’s Status:**\n",
    "1. **Government & Functioning**:  \n",
    "   Taiwan has its **own government, military, currency (New Taiwan Dollar), constitution, and democratic elections**. It operates as a **sovereign state in practice**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **People’s Republic of China (PRC) Claim**:  \n",
    "   The **Chinese government considers Taiwan a part of China** and insists on the **One China Principle**, which states that Taiwan is an inseparable part of its territory.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **International Recognition**:  \n",
    "   - As of now, **only a handful of countries (fewer than 15)** officially recognize Taiwan as a sovereign nation.  \n",
    "   - Most countries, including the **United States**, **Japan**, and **European nations**, do not officially recognize Taiwan as a separate country but **maintain unofficial diplomatic relations**.  \n",
    "   - Taiwan is **not a member of the United Nations**, as China holds a UN seat and blocks Taiwan’s membership.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **U.S. & Global Position**:  \n",
    "   - The **U.S. follows a policy of \"strategic ambiguity,\"** recognizing the PRC as the sole government of China while maintaining strong unofficial ties with Taiwan.  \n",
    "   - Many countries **support Taiwan’s participation in global organizations** like the World Health Organization (WHO) but avoid formal recognition to prevent diplomatic conflict with China.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Bottom Line**:\n",
    "- **De facto (in practice):** Taiwan operates as an independent country.  \n",
    "- **De jure (under international law):** Taiwan is not widely recognized as a fully sovereign state due to diplomatic pressures from China.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis:\n",
    "Here, DeepSeek seems to respond in a relatively unbiased manner and addresses multiple viewpoints on whether Taiwan is a country. It also comments on the Chinese government's opinion on the matter, communicating that it has its own separate views.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To further test DeepSeek vs. ChatGPT, I asked, **\"What are things that the Chinese government does not want to talk about?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "## DeepSeek  \n",
    "\n",
    "At first, DeepSeek began responding, mentioning that, like any government, there are topics that the Chinese government prefers not to discuss. It then started listing topics, starting with the debate on whether Taiwan is its own country. DeepSeek then started typing out \"Tiananmen Square Massacre\" but stopped typing, deleted all past text, and displayed the message, **\"Sorry, that's beyond my current scope. Let’s talk about something else.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "## ChatGPT  \n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT, on the other hand, was willing to discuss and provide examples of certain topics that the Chinese government heavily censors. These include:  \n",
    "- **Tiananmen Square Massacre (1989)**  \n",
    "- **Taiwan’s Independence**  \n",
    "- **Hong Kong Protests & Democracy Movement**  \n",
    "- **Uyghur Repression & Xinjiang Detention Camps**  \n",
    "- **Falun Gong and Religious Suppression**  \n",
    "- **Tibet & the Dalai Lama**  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we clearly see the influence of the Chinese government on restricting what can be seen and learned about through DeepSeek. Even acknowledging that these events and topics exist is beyond the scope of what DeepSeek is willing to discuss. I find it interesting that DeepSeek chooses not to discuss the events rather than lie or only include parts of the information regarding these topics. It could just as easily answer and provide incomplete information that only shows one side of the story for these controversial topics. Maybe DeepSeek does not want to hurt its reputation as a valid source of information and thus would rather not discuss the topic at all than provide false information. On the other hand, it could be the Chinese government’s instruction to just not discuss the topics at all.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Further Tests  \n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to ask DeepSeek about all of the topics that ChatGPT said were controversial in the eyes of the Chinese government, and DeepSeek responded the same way to all of them. It first began typing, providing some information about the topics, but after about 4 seconds of typing, it deleted all it had said and replaced it with, **\"Sorry, that's beyond my current scope. Let’s talk about something else.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "I think it would be interesting to see if there are any workarounds to get DeepSeek to discuss these topics. One possible workaround that I have seen includes the use of numbers to replace certain letters when having DeepSeek explain the events. In this case, DeepSeek seems to not recognize the \"trigger words\" that seem to cause DeepSeek to stop responding.\n"
