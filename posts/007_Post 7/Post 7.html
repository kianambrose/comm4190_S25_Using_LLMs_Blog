<h1>Understanding Complex Topics: Which AI Explains It Best?</h1>
<p>In this blog post, I’ll be comparing how three leading AI models—Claude by Anthropic, GPT by OpenAI, and Deepseek—explain complex topics that many of us find challenging to understand.</p>
<p>I’ve selected four notoriously difficult concepts: quantum entanglement, mRNA vaccines, climate feedback loops, and machine learning algorithms. For each topic, I asked the same question to all three AI assistants and evaluated their explanations based across three key metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clarity</strong>: How easy is the explanation to follow?</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: How well does it avoid unnecessary jargon?</li>
<li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: Does it explain the concept correctly without oversimplification?</li>
</ul>
<p>My goal is to discover which AI assistant can best bridge the gap between complex technical knowledge and everyday understanding. Whether you’re a student, professional, or simply curious about these topics, this comparison will help you identify which AI might be your best learning companion.</p>

<p>Quantum entanglement is like having two magical coins that are connected in a strange way. Imagine you and your friend each take one coin and travel to opposite sides of the universe. When you flip your coin and it lands on heads, your friend’s coin instantly shows heads too - every single time!</p>

<p>Quantum entanglement challenges our understanding of reality in several ways:</p>

<section id="overview" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Quantum entanglement is a fascinating phenomenon in quantum physics where particles become interconnected so that the state of one particle instantly influences the state of another, regardless of the distance between them. This means when you measure one particle’s properties (like spin), the other particle’s properties are instantly determined, even if they’re light-years away.</p>
</section>
<section id="superposition-and-qubits" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="superposition-and-qubits">Superposition and Qubits</h3>
<p>In quantum mechanics, particles like qubits can exist in multiple states at once—a superposition. When two qubits are entangled, their combined state is linked. For example, one qubit could be a superposition of spin up or down, while the other must always match that when measured.</p>
</section>
<section id="entangled-state" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="entangled-state">Entangled State</h3>
<p>When these particles become entangled, they form an “entangled” state where their properties are correlated. If you measure one particle’s spin and it’s up, the other will definitely also be up, no matter how far apart they are in space.</p>
</section>
<section id="correlated-properties" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="correlated-properties">Correlated Properties</h3>
<p>The key aspect of entanglement is that when measured, these particles share properties instantly. This means if you measure one at a certain time, the other’s state is determined before you can observe it, even across vast distances without any need for information traveling faster than light (which is not possible according to current understanding).</p>
</section>
<section id="no-faster-than-light-communication" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="no-faster-than-light-communication">No Faster-Than-Light Communication</h3>
<p>Some debate exists about entanglement since it suggests faster-than-light communication isn’t possible. While this may seem counterintuitive from a classical perspective, it challenges our understanding of reality and causality in quantum mechanics.</p>
<section id="conclusion" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>Quantum entanglement is an intriguing aspect of quantum physics that links particles so they share properties instantaneously, even across large distances. It raises questions about the nature of reality and potential for future technologies like advanced computing.</p>

<h1>gpt-4o</h1>
<p>Quantum entanglement is a fascinating concept from the world of quantum physics, which deals with the behavior of very tiny particles like electrons and photons. Let’s break it down in simple terms:</p>
<p>Imagine you have two tiny particles that are like best friends. No matter how far apart these particles are, even if one is on Earth and the other is on the moon, they are connected in a special way. This connection means that whatever happens to one particle instantly affects the other, no matter the distance between them. This relationship is what we call “entanglement.”</p>
<p>To put it into an analogy: think of having a pair of magic gloves. If you wore one glove, the other one, no matter where it is in the universe, would always be the opposite; if you turn your glove inside out, the other glove turns inside out at the same time, even if it’s miles away. This instantaneous communication between our “magic gloves” is like how entangled particles behave.</p>
<p>Quantum entanglement is important in physics because it challenges our traditional ideas of how things should work, particularly the idea that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. This has led to interesting theories and experiments, such as quantum teleportation (sending information using entangled particles) and potential breakthroughs in creating super-fast and secure communication systems, like quantum computers and cryptography.</p>
<p>Overall, understanding entanglement helps scientists explore and test the boundaries of quantum mechanics, which is essential for advancing technology and unlocking new discoveries in physics.</p>

<section id="analysis" class="level1">
<h1>Analysis</h1>
<p>In my opinion, GPT-4o and Claude did a better job of explaining quantum entanglement in simple terms because of their use of a simplified example. Claude provided a simple example of coins, and GPT provided a similar example using gloves. DeepSeek used some jargon, such as “superposition,” and described qubits, which may have been unnecessary and added confusion for someone without a physics background. Overall, they all achieved the goal of explaining the topic clearly, but the ability of Claude and GPT to provide a simple example allowed me to picture what was being described. I also think that Claude’s explanation was the easiest to follow because it was broken into sections. GPT returned paragraphs of writing, which is not visually appealing and may deter some from reading. I don’t think that any of the models oversimplified anything, because they all stayed very surface-level and did not try to explain anything more than the basic premise.</p>

<p>mRNA vaccines teach your body to protect itself using a simple instruction manual rather than using weakened germs.</p>
<section id="the-basic-process" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-basic-process">The Basic Process</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>The Instructions</strong>: mRNA vaccines contain a small piece of genetic code (like a recipe card) that has instructions for making just one part of the virus - typically the “spike” that sits on its surface.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Delivery</strong>: This instruction manual is wrapped in tiny fat bubbles that help it enter your cells.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Production Line</strong>: Once inside, your cells read these instructions and temporarily make copies of just that viral spike protein.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Training Exercise</strong>: Your immune system spots these spike proteins and recognizes them as foreign. It then creates antibodies and trains immune cells to recognize this specific part.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Memory Formation</strong>: Your body remembers how to fight the real virus if you’re ever exposed.</p></li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-theyre-different-from-traditional-vaccines">How They’re Different From Traditional Vaccines</h3>
<p>Traditional vaccines use: - Weakened live viruses (like measles vaccines) - Killed viruses (like flu shots) - Pieces of viruses grown in labs</p>
<p>mRNA vaccines don’t contain any virus at all - just the instructions for making one small part. This means: - They can’t cause the disease - They’re faster to develop when new threats emerge - They don’t need to be grown in eggs or cells, making production more efficient</p>
<p>The mRNA itself disappears from your body within days, leaving only your immune system’s memory of what it learned.</p>

<li><p><strong>Reduced Risk of Side Effects</strong>: mRNA vaccines are less likely to cause adverse reactions like rashes or allergies because they don’t involve immunogenic proteins.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Broader Antibodyism</strong>: mRNA vaccines can target any viral antigens from any source, making them potentially more adaptable and effective against a broader range of threats.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Simplicity in Production</strong>: The process is simpler, requiring less preparation and fewer steps compared to traditional vaccination methods.</p></li>

<p>In summary, mRNA vaccines offer a potentially safer, more adaptable approach to immunization by focusing on genetic information from mRNA and bacterial extract.

<section id="gpt-4o-1" class="level1">
<h1>gpt-4o</h1>
<p>mRNA vaccines work like giving your body a set of instructions to help it protect itself against certain viruses. Imagine your body as a factory that can produce many different things. These vaccines deliver a message, like a recipe card, telling your body how to make a small, harmless piece of a virus. Specifically, they instruct your cells to produce a protein found on the surface of the virus.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works: Once the mRNA (the instructions) is inside your body’s cells, your cells read the instructions and start making the virus protein. This doesn’t cause any disease; it’s just a part of the virus, not the whole thing.</p>
<p>Your immune system, which defends you against illnesses, notices this new protein and immediately gets to work figuring out how to fight it. It builds up defenses, like training soldiers, so that if the real virus ever tries to infect you in the future, your immune system is ready to recognize and destroy it quickly.</p>
<p>What sets mRNA vaccines apart from traditional vaccines is that older vaccines usually contain a weakened or inactivated form of the actual virus or parts of it. In contrast, mRNA vaccines don’t need any part of the virus itself in their production, just the blueprint (the mRNA) to make a small but recognizable piece of it. This method is typically faster to develop and can be more easily adjusted if needed, making it a powerful tool against rapidly changing viruses.</p>
</section>
<section id="analysis-1" class="level1">
<h1>Analysis</h1>
<p>For me, GPT was the easiest to follow because it again provided an analogy for what was happening. It developed an analogy that one could easily picture in their mind and described the mRNA vaccine through the analogy. I think that DeepSeek did a good job of defining what mRNA actually was instead of assuming that the reader already had a background in mRNA. Additionally, the structure of the DeepSeek response is slightly different from the other two. After defining mRNA, it also discusses how the vaccine is made, something that the other models do not address. I think that Claude and GPT focused more on breaking down the process of how the vaccine works, which was a crucial part of the question. I don’t think that any of the models use too much technical language, but for someone with no background in biology or chemistry, I think the GPT response would be the most helpful in communicating the gist of what is happening.</p>

<section id="topic-3-climate-feedback-loops" class="level1">
<h1>Topic 3: Climate Feedback Loops</h1>
<p>Prompt: “Explain what climate feedback loops are, including both positive and negative feedbacks. How do they impact climate change?” # Claude 3.7 ## Climate Feedback Loops and Their Impact on Climate Change</p>
<p>Climate feedback loops are cyclical processes in the Earth’s climate system where an initial change triggers a sequence of effects that either amplify (positive feedback) or diminish (negative feedback) the original change. These mechanisms play crucial roles in regulating our planet’s climate and significantly influence climate change dynamics.</p>
<section id="positive-feedback-loops" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="positive-feedback-loops">Positive Feedback Loops</h3>
<p>Positive feedback loops <strong>amplify</strong> the initial change, potentially accelerating climate change:</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Ice-Albedo Feedback</strong>
<ul>
<li>Initial warming melts ice and snow</li>
<li>Darker land/ocean surfaces exposed, absorbing more solar radiation</li>
<li>Additional warming occurs, causing more ice to melt</li>
<li>Creates a self-reinforcing cycle of warming</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Water Vapor Feedback</strong>
<ul>
<li>Warming atmosphere holds more water vapor</li>
<li>Water vapor is a potent greenhouse gas</li>
<li>More water vapor traps more heat</li>
<li>Further increases atmospheric temperature</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Permafrost Methane Release</strong>
<ul>
<li>Warming thaws permafrost</li>
<li>Frozen organic matter decomposes, releasing methane and CO₂</li>

</section>
<section id="negative-feedback-loops" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="negative-feedback-loops">Negative Feedback Loops</h3>
<p>Negative feedback loops <strong>counteract</strong> the initial change, potentially stabilizing climate:</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-examples-1">Key Examples:</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Blackbody Radiation</strong>
<ul>
<li>As Earth warms, it emits more infrared radiation to space</li>
<li>This increased radiation helps cool the planet</li>
<li>Acts as a natural thermostat</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cloud Formation Feedbacks</strong>
<ul>
<li>Some types of clouds reflect sunlight back to space</li>

</section>
<section id="impact-on-climate-change" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="impact-on-climate-change">Impact on Climate Change</h3>
<p>The interplay between feedback loops significantly affects climate change in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amplification</strong>: Positive feedbacks can accelerate warming beyond what would be expected from greenhouse gas emissions alone</li>
<li><strong>Tipping Points</strong>: Feedback mechanisms may push climate systems past critical thresholds, leading to rapid, irreversible changes</li>
<li><strong>Uncertainty</strong>: The complex interactions between different feedback loops create challenges for climate prediction</li>
<li><strong>Regional Variations</strong>: Feedbacks can operate differently across geographical regions</li>
<li><strong>Time Delays</strong>: Some feedbacks operate on different timescales, creating lag effects in the climate system</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, research suggests that positive feedbacks are outweighing negative ones in our warming climate, which is concerning for future climate stability. Understanding these complex feedback mechanisms is essential for accurate climate modeling and developing effective mitigation strategies.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="climate-feedback-loops-1">Climate Feedback Loops</h2>
<p>Climate feedback loops are processes that can either amplify or dampen the effects of climate change. They play a crucial role in determining the rate and extent of climate change by affecting the Earth’s energy balance. Feedback loops are categorized into two types: positive feedback loops and negative feedback loops.</p>
<section id="positive-feedback-loops-2" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="positive-feedback-loops-2">Positive Feedback Loops</h3>
<p>Positive feedback loops enhance or amplify changes; this tends to move a system away from its equilibrium state and make it more unstable. In the context of climate change, positive feedback loops exacerbate warming. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Ice-Albedo Feedback:</strong> As global temperatures rise, ice and snow begin to melt. Ice and snow are highly reflective, so their presence helps to cool the planet by reflecting sunlight back into space. When they melt, darker ocean or land surfaces are exposed, which absorb more sunlight and lead to further warming and more ice melt.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Water Vapor Feedback:</strong> Warmer temperatures increase evaporation, adding more water vapor to the atmosphere. Water vapor is a potent greenhouse gas, and its increased concentration can lead to more warming and amplify the initial temperature rise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Permafrost Thaw:</strong> As temperatures rise, permafrost thaws, releasing stored methane—a potent greenhouse gas. The release of methane leads to further warming, which can cause more permafrost to thaw.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="negative-feedback-loops-2" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="negative-feedback-loops-2">Negative Feedback Loops</h3>
<p>Negative feedback loops reduce changes; they tend to hold a system to some equilibrium state, making it more stable. In the context of climate change, negative feedback loops counteract warming. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Cloud Cover Feedback:</strong> Increased temperatures may lead to more cloud formation. Clouds can have a cooling effect as they reflect sunlight back to space (albedo effect), thus reducing the warming.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enhanced Plant Growth:</strong> Higher carbon dioxide levels can lead to increased plant growth in some regions, which absorbs more CO2 from the atmosphere and potentially reduces greenhouse gas concentrations.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="impact-on-climate-change-1" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="impact-on-climate-change-1">Impact on Climate Change</h3>
<p>The interplay between positive and negative feedback loops significantly impacts the Earth’s climate system. Positive feedbacks tend to accelerate the rate of climate change, making mitigation efforts more urgent. Negative feedbacks can provide some buffering effect against climate change, but they are often insufficient to counteract the strong warming pressures from positive feedbacks.</p>
<p>Understanding these feedback mechanisms is key to predicting climate change scenarios and developing strategies to mitigate its impacts. Accurate climate models must account for these feedback loops to predict the future climate accurately and to create effective climate policies.</p>

<h1>Analysis</h1>
<p>Here, GPT’s response is the clearest to me. The language is easiest to understand, and the structure of delivering information makes sense. Claude’s response is also structured well; however, I find the language slightly more difficult to follow, and I think its explanations of the examples are not as thorough and would require further prompting to understand what each example was talking about. I find DeepSeek’s response to be the worst. It does not provide examples of positive and negative feedback, and after reading, I am still unsure if I understand what climate feedback loops are. Additionally, the response from DeepSeek was significantly shorter than the other two models, and I would have liked more information even for a snapshot initial explanation. DeepSeek also did not separately address the effect on climate change like the other two models; instead, it hinted at the effects within the descriptions of the negative and positive feedback loops.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-machine-learning">What is Machine Learning?</h3>
<p>Machine learning is like teaching a computer to learn from experience, similar to how we humans learn. Instead of programming specific instructions for every task, we give the computer examples and let it figure out the patterns.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="neural-networks-the-brain-inspired-approach">Neural Networks: The Brain-Inspired Approach</h3>
<p>Neural networks are machine learning algorithms inspired by how our brains work. Here’s how they function:</p>
<section id="the-building-blocks" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-building-blocks">1. The Building Blocks</h4>
<p>Imagine a neural network as a team of workers (called “neurons”) organized in layers: - <strong>Input Layer</strong>: Workers who receive the initial information - <strong>Hidden Layers</strong>: Middle-management workers who process the information - <strong>Output Layer</strong>: Final decision-makers who provide the answer</p>

<section id="how-information-flows" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-information-flows">2. How Information Flows</h4>
<p>Let’s say we want to teach a computer to recognize pictures of cats:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We show the computer a picture (input)</li>
<li>The picture gets broken down into simple features (like edges and colors)</li>
<li>Each input worker passes what they see to the middle-management workers</li>
<li>Each connection between workers has a “strength” (called a “weight”)</li>
<li>Middle-management workers decide what’s important based on these connection strengths</li>
<li>This continues until the output workers make the final decision: “Cat” or “Not a cat”</li>

<p>How does the network get better at recognizing cats?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Training</strong>: We show the network thousands of pictures labeled “Cat” or “Not cat”</li>
<li><strong>Feedback Loop</strong>: When the network makes a mistake, it adjusts the connection strengths</li>
<li><strong>Small Improvements</strong>: Each adjustment makes the network slightly better</li>
<li><strong>Practice Makes Perfect</strong>: After seeing many examples, the network becomes good at recognizing cats</li>
</ul>

<section id="real-world-example" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="real-world-example">Real-World Example</h3>
<p>Think about how you learned to identify birds: - At first, you might not know the difference between a robin and a cardinal - After seeing many examples and being corrected, you learn to notice the red color, beak shape, etc. - Eventually, you can identify birds without thinking too hard about it</p>
<p>Neural networks learn in a similar way—through examples, feedback, and gradual improvement! # deepseek-r1:1.5b <strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Think of it as teaching computers to learn from data instead of being told exactly what you want them to do. It’s like understanding by observing many examples and figuring out the best way to make decisions based on that experience.</p>
<p><strong>Neural Networks (Simplified):</strong> Imagine a brain with different parts working together, each part doing a small but important job. In a neural network, these are called neurons, connected in layers. Each neuron processes information, making simple decisions. The activation function is how it decides if it should fire or not based on the input. Weights and biases adjust how these connections work, helping the network learn.</p>
<p><strong>How Neural Networks Learn:</strong> 1. <strong>Training with Data:</strong> Feed a lot of labeled examples to the network. It learns by adjusting its weights so it makes fewer mistakes. 2. <strong>Backpropagation:</strong> When wrong answers are given (loss), the network calculates where it went wrong and adjusts its strengths (weights) and starting points (biases). 3. <strong>Avoid Overfitting:</strong> Use techniques like simplifying the model or making it less sensitive to small changes.</p>
<p><strong>Practical Uses:</strong> - Image Recognition (like MNIST with neural networks) - Predicting Prices (using linear regression) - Analyzing Sentences (neural networks in NLP)</p>
<p>In summary, neural networks are flexible tools that learn from data through layers of processing, adjusting their strengths and starting points to minimize errors. They can solve various problems, from recognizing patterns to predicting outcomes, making them versatile for many tasks.</p>

<p>Imagine you have a plant and you want to make sure it gets just the right amount of water. Not too little, not too much. You keep track of how much water you give it and how the plant responds.

<li><p><strong>Layers:</strong> Neurons are organized into layers. The first layer might decide if the amount of sunlight is enough, the next layer might check if the soil is good, and yet another might consider the water amount.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Output:</strong> This is the result or decision. After passing through the neurons and layers, the network gives an output, like “Give more water” or “Everything is perfect.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Learning:</strong> Just like you learn the best way to water your plant, neural networks learn by making predictions, seeing if they’re right, and then adjusting. This happens over and over, getting better each time.</p></li>

<h1>Analysis</h1>
<p>Here, GPT provides the simplest example, and its response assumes the least previous knowledge about computers and machine learning. I think that the examples provided with ChatGPT and Claude were both very helpful in understanding the topic. The explanation of why to use neural networks in GPT’s response was especially helpful for understanding and is something that the other models did not do. All of the responses did a good job of breaking up the explanations into different parts. Again, I think DeepSeek’s response falls a little bit short. I would have liked a little more in-depth explanation and maybe an example to solidify the process in my brain. The real-world example in the Claude response was a good addition and is something that I wish the other two models included. Overall, the language is pretty comparable among the three models, and I think the main difference is in their approach to explaining the topics and how simple they make the examples to help with explaining.</p>

<section id="summary" class="level1">
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>From my experience comparing GPT, Claude, and DeepSeek, I found that GPT consistently provided the clearest explanations. Its language was the easiest to follow, and it structured information in a way that made sense. I especially appreciated its use of analogies, which helped me picture concepts more easily. Claude also did a good job, particularly with its structured formatting and real-world examples, though I sometimes felt like I needed to ask follow-up questions to fully understand certain explanations.</p>
<p>DeepSeek, on the other hand, fell short for me in most cases. It often lacked detail, didn’t provide enough examples, and sometimes used unnecessary jargon that made concepts harder to grasp. For instance, when explaining climate feedback loops, it didn’t separate the effects on climate change like the other two models did, making the explanation feel incomplete.</p>
